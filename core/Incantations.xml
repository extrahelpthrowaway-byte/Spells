      <p class="indent">5 Incantations: Wildfire - You create a fast-heating wildfire to engulf objects/characters. All targets in a 10-ft radius must make a Dexterity saving throw, suffering 6d8 fire damage on a failed save and half damage on a success.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p class="indent">7 Incantations: Fireball - You create a near-instantanous explosion to destroy objects/characters. All targets in a 15-ft radius must make a Dexterity saving throw, suffering 8d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success.</p>

      <p>Exceeding 3 incantations above your current class level will require a d20 roll (success: 12+) to add more incantation stacks. Failing this roll will cause your character to damage their magical focus, taking 1d8 damage.</p>
